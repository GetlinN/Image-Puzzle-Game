# Image Puzzle Game

Developed as my Final Project for the Stanford University class CS106A (Spring 2020) under Prof. Mehran Sahami and Prof. Chris Piech withing the project Code in place.  

I wanted to acquire knowledge in using images and building graphic user interface (GUI), so I designed this memory game. 
The user uploads his/her image, shuffles it, and then puts the pieces back in the right order. Depending on the image itself it can be easy enough or can be pretty complex. 

**Libraries used:**
- tkinter (ImageTk, Image, filedialog, messagebox)
- PIL (ImageTk, Image)
- resizeimage
- random

**Brainstorming on features to add:**

- add a timer and a high score page;
- add information about the image or the artist; 
- advanced version where only certain moves are available - like you can only swap two tiles that are currently touching;
- add more pieces for additional complexity;
- add filters for additional complexity.
